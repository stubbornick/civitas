Civitas experiments
===================

This directory contains scripts to run performance tests for Civitas.

There are Perl scripts to automate the starting of services, the creation of
keys, and the elections phases, in the subdirectory src. There are experiment 
files that provide parameters for the experiment.

This distribution contains sample experiment description files, with
the suffice ".exp". For example, see the file "sample1.exp" for a
sample experiment, with 5 voters, designed to run all services
(tellers, bulletin boards, ballot boxes, etc.) on localhost. The file
explains the syntax of experiment description files. The file
"sample2.exp" provides a similar experiment, but with 100 voters.
  
Try running the experiment "sample1.exp". Make sure that your current directory
is the Civitas installation directory. Then execute the following command:

 $ experiments/src/coordinator.pl experiments/sample1.exp

   (On non-Windows system, the requirement to be in the Civitas
    installation directory can be removed. However, the file
    sample1.exp must be edited to do so. See sample1.exp for more
    information.)

The Perl script coordinator.pl uses an experiment description file to
generate appropriate keys, start up appropriate services (bulletin
board, tellers, ballot boxes) on appropriate machines, and simulate an
election, by simulating the actions of the election supervisor,
election registrar, and voters. Upon successful completion of an
experiment, results are reported, and stored in a directory specified
by the experiment description file.

Notes:
-----
- Prior to running the experiments, you must have correctly configured
  Civitas and the software components it depends upon. Please see the
  README file in the root directory of this distribution.

- The scripts use ps to determine which processes to kill at the end of an
  experiment. On Windows/Cygwin machines, ps may not provide enough 
  information, in which case some processes will be left running.
